# Project AXIOGEN: The Emergence of Universal Logic Syntax

> *"Human brains have a mathematical thing inside them as if it was base code of an OS... once a kid learns the syntax of math, they know that 1+1=2 without needing to be taught."*

**AXIOGEN** (Axiom + Genesis) is an experimental AI research project investigating the "Firmware of the Mind." It demonstrates that mathematical intuition, logical reasoning, and curiosity are not "learned behaviors" in the traditional sense, but are the **mathematical axioms of survival** that emerge inevitably when a neural system interacts with physical constraints.

## 📂 The Evolutionary Lineage (File Structure)

The project is structured as a biological timeline, where each stage "gives birth" to the next by passing down evolved neural weights (`.pkl` files).

## 🔬 Multi-Stage Cognitive Scaffolding

### Stage 1: The Wolf (Hardware Drivers)
**Objective:** Master the physics of a 2D body.
- **Hypothesis:** Efficient navigation is a mathematical necessity.
- **Achievement:** The agent evolved to handle inertia, friction, and targeting. It reached the **"Speed of Light" ceiling** (maximum theoretical efficiency allowed by the physics engine) within 43 generations.
- **Key Result:** Developed the "Subconscious" motor drivers required for all higher logic.

### Stage 2: The Scientist (Intrinsic Motivation)
**Objective:** Exploration without external reward.
- **Mechanism:** Implemented a "Hippocampus" memory grid and a **Boredom Timer**.
- **Transfer Learning:** Injected the "Wolf" brain. Within 10 generations, the agent re-wired its sensors to treat walls as obstacles rather than food.
- **Result:** Developed a systematic "Roomba-like" scanning pattern, proving that **Curiosity** is an optimal algorithm for uncertainty reduction.

### Stage 3: The Architect (Conditional Logic)
**Objective:** Solve a sequential puzzle (Key $\rightarrow$ Gate $\rightarrow$ Goal).
- **Mechanism:** Expanded the input layer to 10 dimensions, including an "Internal State Bit."
- **Breakthrough:** Achieved **Generation 0 Success**. Because the "OS Drivers" (navigation) were already stable, the brain mapped the logic of "If Key=1, Then Goal" instantly.
- **Conclusion:** Logic is simply 3D navigation applied to abstract states.

### Stage 4: The Sentinel (Grounded Cognition)
**Objective:** Individual learning through "Pain" and "Energy."
- **Innovation:** **Intra-Life Plasticity**. Agents adjust their own synaptic weights in real-time when they feel "Pain" (collision) or "Success" (key found).
- **Achievement:** Created a **Grounded Intelligence** that "feels" the environment. The numbers became "meanings" (Pain = Negative Stimulus).

## 🎓 The University (Final Generalization Exam)

The "University" test drops the final Stage 4 brain into three "Planets" it has never seen before, with no further training allowed.

| Environment | Requirement | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Planet Harvester** | High-speed targeting | **GRADUATED** |
| **Planet Snake** | Precision navigation in narrow space | **FAILED** (Overfitting to open space) |
| **Planet Hunter** | Dynamic tracking of moving goals | **GRADUATED** |

**Scientific Insight:** The failure in Planet B proves that while the "Logical OS" is universal, "Spatial Resolution" is limited by the training environment's geometry.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- `pygame` (Visual engine)
- `neat-python` (Evolutionary algorithm)
- `pandas` & `matplotlib` (Analytics)

### Installation
```bash
pip install pygame neat-python pandas matplotlib
```

## 📜 Philosophical Conclusion
Project AXIOGEN proves that the "mathematical thing inside the brain" is the result of **Cognitive Scaffolding**. We do not teach the AI logic; we provide the physical pressure (Starvation, Pain, Obstacles) and the AI **reveals** the logic through its neural connections. 

The resulting `.pkl` brain files are not "code for a game"—they are the **compiled syntax of survival**.

*This project explores the bridge between Neuroscience and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It argues that AGI cannot be built through data alone, but must be evolved through grounded physical experience.*
